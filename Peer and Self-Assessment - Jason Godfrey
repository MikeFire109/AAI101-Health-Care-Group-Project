This project was a true collaboration between Michael and me. I helped design and explain the main idea behind Cardinal AI, which is a new, data-driven Health Risk Assessment that uses continuous data from wearables and sensors. We worked on defining the product’s purpose, demonstrating how modern data collection can improve prediction accuracy, and ensuring our proposal clearly linked machine learning methods to real healthcare needs.

One of the most valuable AI concepts I learned was how explainable models can help improve clinical decision-making. Knowing how to balance performance and transparency will be very useful in future classes and real-world AI projects.

Our team worked well together. Michael and I split tasks based on our strengths. He focused on model selection and data strategy, while I worked on the product story, ethics, and presentation. Working with Michael was both productive and easy. He is very knowledgeable and was flexible about meeting on weekends and using Teams. Even though I travel to different states each week, we kept up steady communication and made good progress. I would gladly work with Michael again.

With more time or resources, I would have liked to make the presentation stronger by presenting a more polished product.
