Key ethical concerns:
The main ethical issues for Cardinal AI are how it collects, protects, and uses sensitive health and behavioral data. Because it gathers data all the time, it needs strong privacy protections and clear consent from users. If the data does not include all groups equally, there is a risk of bias, which could lead to unfair or inaccurate health risk assessments. To build trust with users and clinicians and support patient well-being, Cardinal AI should be open about how it works and take responsibility for its actions.

Target market:
Cardinal AI helps health systems, insurers, and wellness organizations improve health risk assessments by using continuous data instead of just annual surveys. As more adults use wearable fitness devices, Cardinal AI uses real-time data to make modeling and personalization better. The platform lets healthcare providers and population health teams combine different data sources and get clear insights for specific groups. Organizations that want to modernize preventive care can benefit from Cardinal AI’s efficient modeling and current information. Cardinal AI gives organizations advanced, flexible tools to keep up with changing patient behaviors and health trends.
