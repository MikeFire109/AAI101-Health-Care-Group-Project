Product: Cardinal AI: This product uses improved data acquisition and machine learning to create a health risk assessment (HRA) that gives meaningful contributions to the health care industry. We will prioritize finding and using the most recent data, personalization, explainability, and efficient modeling when conceptualizing the product. We landed on Cardinal AI because a cardinal can signify essentiality and, more importantly, go Cyclones!

Purpose: It is crucial for health care technology to be ever-improving to fit the needs of constantly evolving humans. Based on our understanding, modern health risk assessments are wildly outdated. Here are two examples of ways HRAs are not being used to the best of their abilities: They rely on infrequently self-reported data (once-a-year questionnaires) and they assume the same relationship across different demographics. There is plenty of research supporting the claim that HRAs do not provide significant health changes, here is one example: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2765690.
