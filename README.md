What is Cardinal AI? Cardinal AI uses improved data acquisition and machine learning to create a health risk assessment (HRA) that gives meaningful contributions to the health care industry. We will prioritize finding and using the most recent data, personalization, explainability, and efficient modeling when conceptualizing the product. We landed on Cardinal AI because a cardinal can signify essentiality and, more importantly, go Cyclones!

Why is Cardinal AI essential? It is crucial for health care technology to be ever-improving to fit the needs of constantly evolving humans. Based on our understanding, modern health risk assessments are wildly outdated. Here are two examples of ways HRAs are not being used to the best of their abilities: They rely on infrequently self-reported data (once-a-year questionnaires) and they assume the same relationship across different demographics. There is plenty of research supporting the claim that HRAs do not provide significant health changes, here is one example: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2765690.

Our data aquisition plan: As we layed out in the 'Purpose' section of the group charter, we believe doctors and data analysts in the health care field have poor methodology when it comes to acquring data. Allow us to explain: as it stands today, the data used for risk health assessments are only gathered through workplace, insurance, and clinical questionnaires. On average, an individual will fill out one of these questionnaires once a year. This is not good enough. Cardinal AI will be supported with more and better data through more frequent questionnaires, health sensors, and smartphones. Modern smartphones have the ability to estimate activity and sleep levels. Health sensors, such as watches and rings, can measure movement, cardiovascular signals, biochemical data, and plenty more.

Our data modeling plan: Before deciding which models to use, we first have to establish what we want to gain from the data modeling stage of this project. Using statistical modeling, we want to predict early health risks and identify drivers of that risk for each individual. Health risks may include (but not limited to) diabetes, cardiovascular events, and obesity and metabolic syndrome risk. As far as models go, we will perform both classification and regression analysis depending on what the type of data calls for. For instance, classification is appropriate to determine if an individual is at a risk of falling (this is common with older individuals). Regression analysis can be used to predict weight trajectory. At this point, it is worth mentioning that we want to be constantly updating the models as we collect more and more data in order to fit the data as best as possible. Finally, we want to analyze the results of our test data using metrics like AUC and Brier Score.

Key ethical concerns: The main ethical issues for Cardinal AI are how it collects, protects, and uses sensitive health and behavioral data. Because it gathers data all the time, it needs strong privacy protections and clear consent from users. If the data does not include all groups equally, there is a risk of bias, which could lead to unfair or inaccurate health risk assessments. To build trust with users and clinicians and support patient well-being, Cardinal AI should be open about how it works and take responsibility for its actions.

Target market: Cardinal AI helps health systems, insurers, and wellness organizations improve health risk assessments by using continuous data instead of just annual surveys. As more adults use wearable fitness devices, Cardinal AI uses real-time data to make modeling and personalization better. The platform lets healthcare providers and population health teams combine different data sources and get clear insights for specific groups. Organizations that want to modernize preventive care can benefit from Cardinal AI’s efficient modeling and current information. Cardinal AI gives organizations advanced, flexible tools to keep up with changing patient behaviors and health trends.

Ethical use statement: Cardinal AI puts patients first and helps clinicians while making sure human judgment stays central. Our system regularly scans to reduce bias and deliver clear and precise results for everyone. Each assessment comes with clear explanations to build trust and help people make informed choices. We keep data safe with strong security, follow all regulations, and only use data with consent. As healthcare and technology change, Cardinal AI keeps improving through regular ethical reviews and updates.
